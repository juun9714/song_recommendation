    <h3>LYRIC</h3>
        
    She was 19 with a baby on the way<br>
    On the East-side of the city, she was working every day<br>
    Cleaning dishes in the evening, she could barely stay awake<br>
    She was clinging to the feeling that her luck was gonna change<br>
    And, 'cross town she would take the bus at night<br>
    To a one bedroom apartment, and when she'd turn on the light<br>
    She would sit down at the table, tell herself that it's alright<br>
    She was waiting on the day she hoped her baby would arrive<br>
    She'd never be alone<br>
    Have someone to hold<br>
    And when nights were cold<br>
    She'd say<br>
    The world's not perfect, but it's not that bad<br>
    If we got each other, and that's all we have<br>
    I will be your mother, and I'll hold your hand<br>
    You should know I'll be there for you<br>
    When the world's not perfect<br>
    When the world's not kind<br>
    If we have each other then we'll both be fine<br>
    I will be your mother, and I'll hold your hand<br>
    You should know I'll be there for you<br><br>
    They were 90 and were living out their days<br>
    On the West-side of the city next to where they got engaged<br>
    They had pictures on the walls of all the memories that they'd made<br>
    And though life was never easy, they were thankful that they stayed<br>
    With each other, and though some times were hard<br>
    Even when she made him angry he would never break her heart<br>
    No, they didn't have the money to afford a fancy car<br>
    But they never had to travel 'cause they'd never be apart<br>
    Even at the end<br>
    Their love was stronger than<br>
    The day that they first met<br>
    They'd say<br>
    The world's not perfect, but it's not that bad<br>
    If we got each other, and that's all we have<br>
    I will be your lover, and I'll hold your hand<br>
    You should know I'll be there for you<br>
    When the world's not perfect<br>
    When the world's not kind<br>
    If we have each other then we'll both be fine<br>
    I will be your lover, and I'll hold your hand<br>
    You should know I'll be there for you<br>
    You should know I'll be there for you<br><br>
    I'm 23, and my folks are getting old<br>
    I know they don't have forever and I'm scared to be alone<br>
    So I'm thankful for my sister, even though sometimes we fight<br>
    When high school wasn't easy, she's the reason I survived<br>
    I know she'd never leave me and I hate to see her cry<br>
    So I wrote this verse to tell her that I'm always by her side<br>
    I wrote this verse to tell her that I'm always by her side<br>
    I wrote this verse to tell her that<br>
    The world's not perfect, but it's not that bad<br>
    If we got each other, and that's all we have<br>
    I will be your brother, and I'll hold your hand<br>
    You should know I'll be there for you<br>
    When the world's not perfect<br>
    When the world's not kind<br>
    If we have each other then we'll both be fine<br>
    I will be your brother, and I'll hold your hand<br>
    You should know I'll be there for you<br>
    You should know I'll be there for you<br>
